# automate-cluster-cleanup

Currently as EYK Cluster deletion is not completely automated, there is still a need to go through the runbook (https://github.com/engineyard/ky-snippets/blob/master/runbooks/common-issues/cluster-removal-manual-tasks.md) for support engineers to complete the process.
This script aims to eliminate the need for support engineers to spend time on completing the process while EYK Cluster Deletion is not fully automated.
